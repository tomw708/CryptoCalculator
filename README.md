Very basic manual crypto wallet to keep track of deposits and price changes from time of deposit, to current time.\n
I found most wallets I used had difficulty tracking coin swaps, as well as only showing percentage changes over the past 24 hours. I wanted a simple way to input my deposits and see price changes according to current price, so that I can try and work out patterns of when was a good time to buy, or when was a bad time to buy. Essentially just wanted a wallet where I could code in whatever details ever popped into my mind, instead of having to manually do it for each coin - which can get confusing as a portfolio grows and more deposits are made.
This is very much a WIP.\n
To run, simply just run "python main.py" from command line\n
Required packages:\n
